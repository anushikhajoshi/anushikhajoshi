Hey! I am Anushikha from Singapore. I am currently an undergraduate student at the University of Toronto, studying mathematics and physics. 
I am originally from Delhi, India; but grew up in Singapore, and went to high school in Tokyo, Japan where I did the IB program. 
I love cycling, painting, music and watching anime. My favourite artists are Phoebe Bridgers, Joji, Tame Impala and Arctic Monkeys.
