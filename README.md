Hey! I am Anushikha from Singapore. I am currently an undergraduate student at the University of Toronto, studying Mathematics and Physics. 
My github is a work in progress where I post some of my computational work, mostly projects I have done in areas of mathematics and computational physics. Feel free to
reach out to me at anushikha.joshi@mail.utoronto.ca!
